          The game is played with a set of 144 tiles based on Chinese characters and symbols,
          although some regional variations may omit some tiles or add unique ones. 
          In most variations, each player begins by receiving 13 tiles. 
          In turn, players draw and discard tiles until they complete a legal 
          hand using the 14th drawn tile to form four melds (or sets) and a pair (eye). 
          A player can also win with a small class of special hands. While many variations of mahjong exist, 
          most variations have some basic rules in common including how a piece is drawn and discarded, 
          how a piece is robbed from another player, the use of suits (numbered tiles) and honors (winds and dragons), 
          the basic kinds of melds allowed, how to deal the tiles and the order of play. Beyond these basic common rules, 
          numerous regional variations exist which may have notably different criteria for legal melds and winning hands, 
          radically different scoring systems and even elaborate extra rules. 
          A group of players may introduce their own house rules which can notably change the feel of play.

        Mahjong is played with a standard set of 144 mahjong tiles. There are always 4 copy of every tiles.
        The tiles are splited into 3 categories: Suited, Honors and Bonus.
        Suited tiles are divided into three suits and each are numbered from 1 to 9.
        The suits are bamboos, dots, and characters. There are four identical copies of each suited tile totaling 108 tiles.
        There are two different sets of honors tiles: winds and dragons.
        The winds are east, south, west, and north, beginning with east.
        The dragons are red, green, and white.
        There are two sets of bonus tiles: flowers and seasons. The flower and season tiles play a unique role in the mechanics of the game.
        We will talk more about Bonus Tiles later.

        The dealer is chosen by various means.
        One of the ways of determining turn order is to place the 4 wind tiles face down and shuffle them.
        Each player randomly select one of these tiles and these tiles dictate their wind position.
        Each player sits down at their respective position (called the wind position) at the table
        in positions of an inverted compass: East is dealer, the right of the dealer is South,
        across is West, and the left is North. The order of play is traditionally counter-clockwise.
