    <div class="content white">
      Mahjong or mah-jongg, is a tile-based game that was developed in the 19th century in
      China and has spread throughout the world since the early 20th century. It is commonly
      played by four players (with some three-player variations found in parts of China, Japan,
      South Korea and Southeast Asia). The game and its regional variants are widely played throughout
      East and Southeast Asia and have also become popular in Western countries. The game has also been
      adapted into a widespread online entertainment. Similar to the Western card game rummy, Mahjong is
      a game of skill, strategy, and luck. To distinguish it from mahjong solitaire, it is sometimes
      referred to as mahjong rummy.</div>
