      <div class="standard-2 white">
        In case you are wondering how long a usual mahjong game will take, it usually take 2-3 hrs to finish
        a game from east to north given that no one "hold" the position of the host. Whenever the game ends,
        depending on whether it is a draw or who wins, the host is either pass down to the next person or
        the host remains as the same person. If the host win that match, the host remain, if someone else win
        the host is pass down anti-clockwise. If the match ended as a draw, host is pass down anti-clockwise,
        if someone kong in that match, the host remain. Once everyone has been the host and it is passed back to
        the original host, the wind proceeds.

      <div class="standard-2 white">
        When a game starts, all players shuffle the faced down mahjong tiles. When the shuffling is done, all players
        take 36 mahjong tiles each, stacking 2 together, so total of 18 stacks of mahjong on the table. Place the stacks
        on your side and rotate it slightly. After that, it is time to decide whos tile to take from. The host will throw
        3 dice. Depending on the number rolled, it determins both who tile to take and the cut off. Starting from the host as 1,
        and the player counter-clockwise of you being 2, the player who get chosen are selected. For example, if a  5 is rolled,
        the host tiles is chosen.  Count the number of stacksby dice rolled starting from the left. That next stack after the
        number ends is where you will start taking the tiles. The host will first take 2 stack and the player counter-clockwise
        will do the same. This repeat until all players has taken 2 stack 3 times. After that, the host will take the top tile
        of the 1st and 3rd stack, while player 2 will take the 1st bottom tile. Player 3 top 2nd tile and player 4 bottom 2nd tile.
        After that, the game will start. Player will continue to draw that tile from the order of which the tile is taken on their
        turn. If any player kong, they will draw the tile at the very end of the tile stacks. Do note that game will end in a
        draw if there are 7.5 stacks (15 tiles) left and no one has win yet.

      <div class="standard-2 white">
        In mahjong, u need to have tai/fan or basically minimum points to declare a win hand. The minimum points varies
        across different style of mahjong, but we will be talking about requiring 1 tai/fan to win. One of the easiest way
        to get tai/fan is by having a triplets of any dragon tiles. Those are considered as 1 tai/fan. Another way is through
        the bonus tile. Bonus tile are basically flower tiles which upon drawing, you place it at the front of your tiles. you
        then draw a tile from the end of the tile stacks. Depending on where the host is, it can either be worth 0 or 1 tai.
        Host will always be number 1, the player anti-clockwise to the host is player 2 and so on. They are indicated by wind.
        Host will be east, player 2 will be south, player 3 will be west and player 4 will be north. If lets say you are south,
        u got a 2 flower tile, it is your wind so you get a tai. Any other number will not count as tai for you. Third way is to
        get triplets of wind tile of your own wind. The current wind, lets say east (1st game) is worth 1 tile. No matter what player
        have triplets of it, they will get a tai/fan. If the host has triplets of it, they will get 2 tai. Another way is to either
        get all triplets(2 tai) or all sequence(1 tai). Thats all for the basics! Enjoy
