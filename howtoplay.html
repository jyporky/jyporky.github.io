        <div class="gp-3 white">
          The main goal of the game is to call a win when holding a winning hand.
          A winning hand consist of 4 sets and 1 pairs. When it is your turn, you
          draw a tile, and discard a tile. You usually want to either form sequence
          or triplets to get a set. There are a few ways to get a set, you can either
          draw it on your own, or form it by discarded tiles directly from opponent.
          More about these will be mentioned later. Since you only ever have 13 tiles
          on your hand. Your 14th tile should either be self-drawn or be from other players.
          You can either chow, pong or gang someone's discard tiles to form a set. When calling
          it, you will reveal the tiles you used to chow/pong/gang, and take the discard tile and
          displace it facing up on the side.

    <div class="standard">
      <div class="standard-1 white">Chow</div>
      <div class="standard-2 white">
        Chow is a method of getting sets from other player's discarded tiles. There are a
        few condition to meet when calling a chow. The person who discard that tile you wanted
        must be the player before your turn. You are not allowed to chow from other players.
        Secondly, it must be a valid sequence, for example. You can chow if you have a 4 pin, 5pin
        and player throws a 6pin. Thirdly, there must be no other player that will pong/gang that tile.
        This is because chow and gang takes more priority than chow. So lets say a player throw a 3 pin,
        you call chow, but someone else call pong or gang, that tile will go to them even though you call
        chow first.

    <div class="standard">
      <div class="standard-1 white">Pong</div>
      <div class="standard-2 white">
        Pong is an another method of getting sets from other player's discarded tiles.
        Unlike chow, you can get discard tiles from anyone. Do note that you must already
        have a pair of the same tile as the discarded tiles in order to call pong. If someone else
        call chow when you call pong, the tiles still goes to you as pong takes higher priority.

      <div class="standard-1 white">Kong</div>
      <div class="standard-2 white">
        Kong is an another method of getting sets from other player's discarded tiles.
        It is one of the hardest set to get unlike chow and kong. You firstly need 3 of the same
        tile in order to set up for a kong. Usually making kong is not worth it unless you all doing
        all triplets win. When u kong, u draw a tile from the end of the tiles (more about this in tips).
        There are 3 ways to kong, one by other player's discard tiles,
        two by drawing a tile u have pong before, like drawing 4 pin when you have
        pong a 4pin before, and lastly the hardest, when you have 4 of the same tiles on hand.

      <div class="t-2 white">
        The main goal of a game is to try and set-up a winning hand and try to win. It is actually not
        that easy to win. In order to win, you need to get 3 sets as well as a pair. If it was just that
        stopping people from winning, the game would have been a lot easier. There is this thing called fan
        or tai, basically points. You need a minimum of 1 point in order to win, you are unable to just win
        with a random 3 sets and a pair that does not give any tai/fan. A simple way to get tai/fan is one
        of the following: Either get a dragon tile or do all triplets or all sequence. To know more about
        tai/fan see tips and tricks.
